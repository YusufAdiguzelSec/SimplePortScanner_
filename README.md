# SimplePortScanner_
This Python-based port scanner checks if ports on a specified IP address are open or closed. The user provides the target IP and port range. The script scans each port, displaying open ones, and handles connection, DNS, and other errors. It's a simple tool for basic network security testing and port discovery.
